Yesterday, my first article was accepted for publication on SeekingAlpha.com, which - I must admit - made me quite proud. The article is about [Enova International Inc.](http://www.enova.co) which just spun off from its parent [Cash America Internatioal Inc.](http://www.cashamerica.com/), and which I consider to be a great buy opportunity right now.<!--more--> The corresponding reasons are given in said article. As the article is accepted as a SeekingAlpha PRO article, this prohibits me to post it on my blog. The article should be made available also to non-PRO SeekingAlpha members (for which a membership is free) in the next 24 hours for a 30 day time frame. After this time window it will again be only accessible to SeekingAlpha PRO subscribers. Here's the corresponding link: [http://seekingalpha.com/article/2695535-enova-international-inc-a-very-attractive-spin-off-opportunity](http://seekingalpha.com/article/2695535-enova-international-inc-a-very-attractive-spin-off-opportunity)
