This is a wordcloud of G. Deleuze's and F. Guattari's _A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia_ created with [this nice tool](http://timc.idv.tw/wordcloud/). I removed all words with less than a hundred occurrences, some abbreviations and otherwise not very expressive words such as _also_, _thus_, _and_ etc. This is where I borrowed the term _rhizome_ from.

By the way, I am definitely not sure if I would recommend the book. Read through [Amazon's customer reviews](http://www.amazon.com/A-Thousand-Plateaus-Capitalism-Schizophrenia/dp/0816614024) section, you'll get the taste.
