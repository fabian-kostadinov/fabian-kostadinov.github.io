This is a non-exhaustive list of websites on stock market investing (and trading) I like for various reasons.<span class="more"></span>

## Yahoo Finance
Link: [http://finance.yahoo.com/](http://finance.yahoo.com/)  
Everyone knows this one. Still one of the best websites on stocks on the net. I particularly enjoy the news section on individual stocks. The message board can be informative sometimes, too. Same thing with the stock's key statistics. There even is information on stock options available. Oh, and did I mention the historical data download? One of my most favorite features above all.  
What is probably less known is that Yaoo Finance also has a section with multiples by sectors and industries available at [http://biz.yahoo.com/p/s_conameu.html](http://biz.yahoo.com/p/s_conameu.html). This is really helpful to compare multiples like P/E, P/B or ROE of a single company to the rest of the sector or industry.  
One drawback is that data quality at Yahoo Finance is not always the best. So you have to be careful with the information you receive.

## Google Finance

Not much to say here either. It's a classic. There's a stock screener, which is nice but does not keep me awake at night.

## SeekingAlpha.com
Link: [http://seekingalpha.com/](http://seekingalpha.com/)  
Currently my favorite site on the net when it comes to stock investing. Even if you (like me...) don't make it to the selected inner circle of _PRO members_ there is still plenty of high quality articles with more investment ideas than you could ever care for. The best ones can be found in the _Top Ideas_ section. A big plus is that you can comment on the articles and engage in a discussion with the authors. Free basic membership.

## 4-traders.com
Link: [http://www.4-traders.com/](http://www.4-traders.com/)  
One particular nice feature of this site is that it displays analyst estimates and revisions graphically over the last few months. Enter a stock short code and then click on _Consensus_ or _Revisions_. On your right hand side there are some boxes containg the current stock price distance to the analysts consensus targets. The rest of the site is not much different from [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/) or [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/).

## Finviz.com
Link: [http://www.finviz.com/](http://www.finviz.com/)  
Finviz's lean design is just to my taste. The front site for every stock features the most important fundamentals on a single page. In contrast to many other stock market sites the website is not clustered with blinking banners and ads. There is also a stock screener with similar capabilities as the one provided by Google Finance.  
When it comes to doing research on sectors and industries, Finviz beats even Yahoo Finance. You can adjust the stock screener to display only a certain sector and industry and then screen through all different sorts of multiples for all the stocks displayed.

## Stock Spinoffs
Link: [http://www.stockspinoffs.com/](http://www.stockspinoffs.com/)  
Want to invest in spinoffs? Then this is your site. Although the website does not cover all US spinoffs, there are regular updates about many different ones with the most important information provided to you for free. Once you like an idea, you can still start doing your own research on the upcoming spinoff, but the site is definitely a great starting point.

## Spinoff Monitor
Link: [http://spinoffmonitor.com/](http://spinoffmonitor.com/)  
A neat site if you are interested in special situation stocks including restructurings, spinoffs and bankruptcy. All this website does is list different stocks currently in a special situation. You can subscribe with your email to get a weekly digest. A great place to get a first idea, which you can then research further.

## Investopedia
Link: [http://www.investopedia.com/](http://www.investopedia.com/)  
The best website on the internet when it comes to educating yourself in stock investing and economics. Lots of articles on ratios, fundamentals, technical indicators, micro- and macroeconomic topics and so on.

## StockCharts.com
Link: [http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school)  
Very informative website on technical indicators. You can find them all: moving averages, MACD, stochastic oscillators, directional movement index and many more.

## What I miss
There are also a few things I miss on the internet.

* A free-to-use stock screener which actually can combine several criteria with boolean values _and_ can compare not only ratios to values but ratios to ratios. Example: "Find me all European stocks with P/E < 10 OR dividends per share > 10% of EPS."
* It is my impression that high quality information on US stocks is much easier to find than on European stocks. Maybe I am looking at the wrong websites or don't understand the language. (I have not much experience with investing in stocks outside North-America and Europe.)
* Free historical options data per stock. I'm sure there are many other people out there who miss such a feature.
